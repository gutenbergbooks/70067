<em>Washington, D. C., June 10, 1916</em>.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>: Since cheese is one of the important agricultural products of
the United States and a foodstuff used in a larger or smaller quantity
in nearly every American home, it seemed desirable to study its
relative nutritive value and the ways in which it may be prepared
for the table.</p>

<p>Although it is so generally liked, there seems to be a widespread
belief that it is not well digested and that it is a cause of physiological
disturbances. Neither of these beliefs is substantiated by the results
of the extended series of digestion experiments undertaken as part of
the nutrition investigations of the Office of Home Economics. Indeed,
cheese was found to be very thoroughly digested, ranking with
other staple foods in this respect. Moreover, experiments made with
the respiration calorimeter did not indicate that it was less easy of
digestion than a comparable amount of meat.</p>

<p>In the studies of the digestibility of cheese the Bureau of Animal
Industry cooperated with the States Relations Service and was also
of great assistance in securing, for experimental purposes, cheese
made and cured under controlled conditions. Supplementing the
experiments as to the nutritive value of cheese, many tests were made
of methods of preparing cheese for the table, the main purpose being
to suggest dishes and combinations of such a character that the
cheese might replace other nitrogenous material and fat when this
seemed desirable.</p>

<p>The bulletin was prepared by C. F. Langworthy, chief of the Office
of Home Economics of the States Relations Service, and Miss Caroline
L. Hunt, who has had wide experience in the study of both
scientific and practical problems in nutrition. The recipes were
collected from many sources and in the majority of cases were
studied experimentally by Miss Hunt.</p>

<p>Acknowledgement should be made to teachers of home economics
in agricultural colleges and other educational institutions, to housekeepers,
and others who have supplied data of great value in preparing
the bulletin.</p>

<p class="center fs130">CHEESE AND ITS ECONOMICAL USES IN THE DIET.</p>
</div>

<hr class="r10">

<h2 class="nobreak" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p>Cheese is believed to be the oldest of the dairy products and the
first form in which milk was preserved for future use. One may
conjecture that it owes its origin to the accidental storing and ripening
of sour milk curd. Although it has been a staple food with many
races for uncounted years, there is a widespread belief that it is
suitable for use chiefly in small quantities as an accessory to the diet,
and that in large quantities it is likely to produce physiological disturbances.
We are inclined, therefore, to think of those who make
cheese one of the chief articles of their diet as being driven to this
course by necessity rather than being led to it by choice.</p>

<p>Because of these opinions extensive studies have been carried on
as a part of the Department Work in Home Economics, of the food
value, thoroughness of digestibility, ease of digestion, physiological
effect, and special character of cheese as food as well as of methods
which are followed in preparing it for the table. The conclusion
drawn from this extended study is, in brief, that cheese properly
prepared and used is not generally a cause of physiological disturbances,
and that it may easily be introduced into the bill of fare in
such quantities as to serve as the chief source of nitrogenous food
and may be made a substitute for other nitrogenous foods when such
substitution is desired.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The results of these studies have been
brought together in this bulletin with a view to making them helpful
to all interested in the subject, but particularly to housekeepers.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of the housekeeper, cheese is of importance
because of its high nutritive value, particularly its high percentage of
protein or muscle-forming materials, because of the ease with which
it can be kept and prepared for the table, and because of its appetizing
flavor and of the great variety of ways in which it can be
served.</p>

<p>From the point of view of agriculture cheese is an important commodity.
The latest census figures available show that considerably
over 300,000,000 pounds are made yearly in the United States, the
value of the product being nearly $29,000,000, and the amount of
money invested being over $6,000,000. The figures quoted are from
the census report which first separated the details of the cheese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</span>
industry from those of the butter and condensed-milk industries.
From earlier statistics available, however, it is fair to judge in a general
way of the development of any one of these industries from the
figures given for the three industries combined. In general, these
figures show that there was a great leap forward in the three industries
in the decade between the years 1880 and 1890, and that since
that time there has been a continuous, steady, healthy growth in
the business of cheese making.</p>

<p>As might be expected, the amount of the product and the amount
of money invested have increased more rapidly than the number of
men employed, indicating that, as in most manufacturing industries,
labor-saving devices and other improvements have reduced the proportion
of physical labor required.</p>

<p>As regards the kind of cheese made in the United States, the figures
show that of the amount produced in 1905 approximately three-fourths
was what is known to the trade as standard factory cheese,
or what is usually known to the retail purchaser as American cheese.
A very small per cent—1.1 per cent—was skim-milk cheese, the
remainder being American modifications of certain important foreign
brands, Neufchâtel, Camembert, and others.</p>

<p>From the standpoint of the retail dealer, cheese is important
because it is a convenient article to handle. Its percentage of nutrients
being high and its percentage of water low, it is not bulky. It is
comparatively easy, too, to preserve in good condition. The difficulty
of cutting exact amounts called for by customers may be considered
the chief inconvenience. Efforts have been made to obviate
this difficulty by making small cheeses. Experiments have been
reported from the Oregon Experiment Station<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> on the canning of
cheese in pound lots; and from the Wisconsin Experiment Station<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
in making cheese prints like those in which butter is commonly sold.
In some of the factories cheeses weighing about 5 pounds and having
the same shape as the larger cheeses are made. These are convenient
for use in families where a large amount of cheese is eaten, and furthermore
cheese in such form dries out and spoils less quickly and easily
than cheese cut in wedge-shaped slices, as it usually is when sold by
the pound. A convenient way of keeping and using such cheese is
given on page <a href="#Page_11">11</a>.</p>

<p>The sale of cheese in pots is another way of overcoming the difficulty
of cutting exact amounts. Cheese thus prepared is, as a rule,
softened by the addition of butter fat or other fat, with the idea of
making it of such consistency that it can be used like soft cheeses.</p>

<p>There is something to be said also of the value of cheese to that not
inconsiderable number of individuals who must occasionally cater<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</span>
for themselves—those men and women in business life, for example,
who find it convenient neither to carry lunches nor to go to restaurants.
For these, cheese offers a convenient way of supplying the
necessary protein, for it can usually be obtained in good condition in
any neighborhood. Combined with crackers, some of the ready-cooked
cereals, or bread, and with fruit, it makes a fairly well-balanced
meal.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHEESE_MAKING">CHEESE MAKING.</h2>
</div>

<p>Though the chief points in the manufacture of cheese are well
known, and are discussed in detail in other publications<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> of this
department, it may not be out of place to review them here. Cheese
is made ordinarily from whole milk, and most of the kinds best known
in the United States from cows’ milk. In every 8 parts of milk by
weight there is approximately 1 part of solid nutrients, the remainder
being water. For our present purpose we may think of the nutrients
as being equally divided into three groups—protein substances
(casein and albumin principally), fat, and milk sugar. In the process
of cheese making the casein, which constitutes more than three-fourths
of the proteids of the milk, is precipitated by rennet, forming
a curd. Most of the fat attaches itself to this curd. The curd is
broken up, and the whole is heated to a temperature between 96°
and 108° F. The whey is drained off and carries with it most of the
milk sugar and the albumin. The curd is salted and pressed. It is
kept for several weeks or longer in a cool place, where it “ripens,”
developing flavors through the action of bacteria or other microorganisms,
and also undergoing certain other marked changes.</p>

<p>The average cheese while fresh and moist contains proteids and fat
in much the same ratio as that in which they are found in the milk.
More than one-fourth its weight is proteid, about one-third fats, and
one-third water. There are always present small amounts of albumin
and sugar which have clung to the curd. Owing to the addition of
salt, the percentage of mineral matter is high compared with that of
most other foods.</p>

<p>In ripening, cheese changes in texture and its original pastiness
gives away to a somewhat granular consistency in some types, or to
a waxy or a buttery consistency in others.</p>

<p>The above brief outline refers only to the essentials of cheese making.
In practice, there are many variations with respect to the kind
of milk used, the proportion of butter fat or cream retained in or
added to the milk, with respect to the methods followed in separating,
preparing, seasoning, and handling the curd, and to the handling
and ripening of the cheese. It follows that there is an almost endless<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
number of cheeses with different names and of different appearance
and flavor.</p>

<p>Cheese making was formerly a home or farm industry, but is now,
in the United States at least, very largely a commercial enterprise
carried on in factories. It differs from many industries in that the
factories are almost always located in the country or in the smaller
towns rather than in large cities, this being more true of cheese
making than of the manufacture of potted cheeses or other special
articles, which has become a large industry. It is worthy of mention
in this connection that the making of cheese crackers and
other bakers’ goods in which cheese is an ingredient has developed
into an important part of the baking trade.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="KINDS_OF_CHEESE_USED_IN_AMERICAN_HOMES">KINDS OF CHEESE USED IN AMERICAN HOMES.</h2>
</div>

<p>The American factory cheese—the so-called American cream
cheese—is of the English Cheddar type, and as it is the most commonly
used of all the commercial varieties in the United States, may
be taken as a standard. Other types are, however, well known, particularly
in cities and large towns where there are well-stocked
markets and stores, and it is interesting to note also, at least briefly,
the characteristics of some of them. Full descriptions of a very
large number of cheeses (about 250 in all) may be found in an earlier
bulletin of this department.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>


<h3>CHEDDAR AND AMERICAN FULL-CREAM CHEESE.</h3>

<p>Cheddar cheese—named from the English village where it originated—is
a comparatively old type of cheese, very popular in England
and also in the United States. The name is now more fitly applied
to a process than to any particular shape.</p>

<p>Cheddar cheese is made from sweet cows’ milk, which may be
skimmed, partly skimmed, or unskimmed. If made from unskimmed
milk the cheese is called “full cream.” If cream is removed the
cheese is designated “part-skim” or “skim,” as the case may be.</p>

<p>Cheese of Cheddar type as made in the United States is perhaps
most often marketed in large, flat, round forms, 13 to 16 inches in
diameter, about 5 or 6 inches in height, and weighing 26 to 32
pounds each, though other shapes and sizes are also fairly common.
It is usually pale to darker yellow in color, though it may be white
when uncolored. When fresh it is mild in flavor, but when well
ripened has a characteristic and sharp taste. The new cheese is soft,
though not waxy, in texture, and may be easily shaved or broken
into small pieces. When well ripened it may be finely grated.</p>

<p>These characteristics, together with its distinctive and peculiar
flavor and its wide distribution in the markets, are qualities which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span>
help to make it the variety most commonly used in the United
States.</p>

<p>Sage cheese is a variety of Cheddar cheese, which is flavored with
sage and is further characterized by the green mottled appearance
formerly due to bits of sage leaf but now generally obtained in another
way.</p>


<h3>ENGLISH DAIRY CHEESE.</h3>

<p>From the standpoint of the cook who frequently wishes to use
grated cheese this variety is important. Though made in much the
same way as Cheddar, it differs from it, in that the curd is heated
to a somewhat higher temperature, and the cheese is therefore
harder. It commonly sells for somewhat more per pound than the
standard or American factory variety and is likely to be found only
in the larger markets.</p>


<h3>SOFT CREAM CHEESES.</h3>

<p>Cream cheese true to name is made from rich cream thickened by
souring or from sweet cream thickened with rennet. The whey is
removed by draining. It is then covered, salted, and turned occasionally,
being ready for market in 5 to 10 days. A variety is also
made with rennet from cream of low fat content, as well as a number
of other special sorts much more common in France than in the
United States.</p>

<p>The term “cream cheese,” however, is an elastic one and includes
many varieties which are sold under special trade names. Such
cheese is common in most markets.</p>

<p>Soft cream cheese differs from standard cheese, so far as composition
is concerned, in having more water and fat and less protein,
water usually making up about one-half of the total weight. It
differs also in being much more perishable. These cheeses commonly
sell for 10 or 15 cents each, which is about 40 to 50 cents a
pound.</p>

<p>Of late there have been on the market varieties of such cheese or
of Neufchâtel, made by combining the cheese with chopped pimiento.
These bring a relatively high price in market and may be easily prepared
at home if this seems more convenient. (See p. <a href="#Page_34">34</a>.)</p>


<h3>NEUFCHÂTEL CHEESE.</h3>

<p>This very popular variety—named from a town in northeastern
France—is similar in appearance and in the way it is marketed to
soft cream cheese. It is made either from whole or skim milk curdled
with rennet. After draining and pressing, it is kneaded thoroughly,
formed into small rolls or blocks, and then ripened until special
molds develop, which requires about four weeks. It is then wrapped
in tinfoil and marketed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span></p>


<h3>PARMESAN CHEESE.</h3>

<p>This is a name given outside of Italy to a very hard cheese which
in that country is said to be known as Grana, a name given because of
the granular appearance which it has after it has been broken. It
is sometimes sold in grated form and brings a relatively high price,
but is more commonly sold ungrated. When well made it will keep
for years and may be easily broken and grated. It is very generally
used in Europe for serving with soups, for seasoning macaroni, and
for other similar purposes, and is quite common in American markets.</p>


<h3>SAP SAGO.</h3>

<p>This is a skim-milk cheese made in Switzerland, which is suitable
for grating. It contains, for every 4 pounds of cheese, 1 pound of a
clover (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Melilotus cæruleus</i>) grown in Switzerland. It is greenish in
color and has an unusual flavor. It is not high-priced.</p>


<h3>GORGONZOLA AND ROQUEFORT.</h3>

<p>These are highly flavored cheeses characterized by the presence
of molds through their entire mass. Roquefort is made from the
milk of sheep; Gorgonzola, from cows’ milk.</p>


<h3>POTTED OR SANDWICH CHEESES.</h3>

<p>Ordinary cheese is often mixed with butter or oil in the proportion
of 5 parts of cheese to 1 of butter or oil, by weight. The mixture
is sometimes seasoned with mustard or with curry powder. Such
cheeses, unseasoned or seasoned, are on the market in great variety.
Potted cheese may be easily prepared at home if the housekeeper
wishes to take the trouble.</p>


<h3>SWISS CHEESE (EMMENTALER, GRUYÈRE, ETC.).</h3>

<p>This term as used in America is somewhat vague. Different
names are given to the varieties according to the districts of Switzerland
in which they are made, but they are all similar and characterized
by a mild, sweetish flavor and the presence of large holes or
“eyes.” Foreign and domestic brands are to be found in most
markets. They are suitable for cooking purposes, as well as for use
without being cooked, and are much used in this way in Europe
and well known and liked in the United States.</p>


<h3>EDAM CHEESE.</h3>

<p>This is a cheese made in Holland. It is molded in spherical form,
and the outside is usually dyed red. It is usual in this country to
cut off a section of the top, which serves as a lid, and to scoop out the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</span>
inside as needed. In Holland it is frequently served in slices, particularly
when it is fresh. Edam cheese is seldom used in cookery in
American homes, though thrifty housewives, after the greater part
of the cheese has been removed, often stuff the hollow shell with
cooked and seasoned macaroni, rice, or something similar and bake.</p>


<h3>BRIE AND CAMEMBERT CHEESE.</h3>

<p>These are very soft rennet cheeses of foreign origin and of somewhat
smaller nutritive value than standard cheese, and of strong flavor and
odor. They are not often used in cookery, but are used as an accompaniment
to other foods. The Bureau of Animal Industry and the
Connecticut Storrs Experiment Station in cooperation have experimented
with the making of Camembert cheese with marked success,
and have published a full account of the work.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>


<h3>COTTAGE CHEESE.</h3>

<p>Cottage cheese and other sour milk and cream cheeses, junket,
Devonshire cream, and a number of other cheese-like products are
described in the section which deals with homemade cheese.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_CARE_OF_CHEESE_IN_THE_HOME">THE CARE OF CHEESE IN THE HOME.</h2>
</div>


<p>One of the best ways of keeping cheese which has been cut is to
wrap it in a slightly damp cloth and then in paper, and to keep it in a
cool place. To dampen the cloth, sprinkle it and then wring it. It
should seem hardly damp to the touch. Paraffin paper may be
used in place of the cloth. When cheese is put in a covered dish, the
air should never be wholly excluded, for if this is done, it molds more
readily.</p>

<p>In some markets it is possible to buy the small whole cheeses mentioned
on page <a href="#Page_6">6</a>. These may be satisfactorily kept by cutting a
slice from the top, to serve as a cover, and removing the cheese as
needed with a knife, a strong spoon, or a cheese scoop. It is possible
to buy at the hardware stores knobs which inserted in the layer
cut from the top make it easy to handle. The cheese below the cover
should be kept wrapped in a cloth.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHEESE_AS_A_FOOD">CHEESE AS A FOOD.</h2>
</div>


<p>Cheese is used in general in two ways—in small quantities chiefly
for its flavor and in large quantities for its nutritive value as well as
for its flavor. Some varieties of cheese are used chiefly for the first
purpose, others chiefly for the second. Those which are used chiefly
for their flavor, many of which are high priced, contribute little to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
food value of the diet, because of the small quantity used at a time.
They have an important part to play, however, in making the diet
attractive and palatable. The intelligent housekeeper thinks of
them not as necessities, but as lying within what has been called “the
region of choice.” Having first satisfied herself that her family is
receiving sufficient nourishment, she then, according to her means
and ideas of an attractive diet, chooses among these foods and
others which are to be considered luxuries.</p>

<p>Those cheeses, on the other hand, which are suitable to be eaten in
large quantities and which are comparatively low priced are important
not only from the point of view of flavor, but also from the
point of view of their nutritive value. Among such cheeses the one
which, as noted above, is known to the trade as standard factory
cheese and to the housewife as American cheese stands out pre-eminently.
Therefore when the word “cheese” is used without
specification in the following pages it may be taken to refer to this
particular variety.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_FLAVOR_OF_CHEESE">THE FLAVOR OF CHEESE.</h2>
</div>


<p>Cheese owes its flavor to the fatty acids and their compounds which
it contains and to ammonia-like bodies formed during ripening from
the cleavage of the casein, to salt added to the curd, and in some
varieties, like Roquefort, to bodies elaborated by molds which develop
in the cheese. In the highly flavored sorts some of the fatty acids of
a very marked odor are present in abundance, as are also the ammonia-like
bodies. Indeed, in eating such cheese as Camembert a trace
of ammonia flavor may often be plainly detected.</p>

<p>The cleavage of the nitrogenous material of the cheese and other
changes are brought about chiefly by the action of enzymes originally
present in cheese or by microorganisms and are to be regarded
as fermentative and not as putrefactive changes.</p>

<p>The liking for highly flavored cheeses of strong odor is a matter
of individual preference, but from the chemist’s standpoint there is
no reason for the statement often made that such cheeses have undergone
putrefactive decomposition.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="COMPOSITION_OF_CHEESE_AND_SOME_OTHER_FOODS_COMPARED">COMPOSITION OF CHEESE AND SOME OTHER FOODS COMPARED.</h2>
</div>


<p>In the present state of our knowledge concerning dietetics it
seems best to give the housekeeper general rather than absolute
rules with respect to the kind and amount of food which should be
eaten at any meal or at any given time by persons in normal health
living under usual conditions. It is not necessary, therefore, for the
housekeeper to know the exact composition of food materials in order
to cater well for her family, a rough approximation being sufficient for
the purpose. In the case of cheese she will be near enough to the fact if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span>
she thinks of it as composed approximately of equal parts by weight
of proteids, fats, and water. This rough conception is sufficient to
associate it in her mind with the foods of high proteid value, a point
which is important in connection with the making of bills of fare. It
should lead her to class it also with the foods which are rich in fat
and prevent her from combining it unnecessarily with other fatty
foods.</p>

<p>In order, however, that the question of the use of cheese in the diet
may be adequately discussed, knowledge of its composition in comparison
with other foods is desirable, and there is an abundance of
data available on this subject, since the composition of cheese and
other foods has often been investigated at the Department of Agriculture,
in experiment station laboratories, and in many other places
where nutrition problems are studied. An extended summary of
analyses of cheese of different sorts is included in an earlier publication
of this department.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

foods are summarized in the following table:</p>

<p>It will be seen from the above table that cheese has nearly twice
as much protein, weight for weight, as beef of average composition
as purchased and that its fuel value is more than twice as great. It
contains over 25 per cent more protein than the same weight of
porterhouse steak as purchased, and nearly twice as much fat.</p>

<p>As shown by the figures in the above table, cheese contains
3.8 per cent ash. Of this a considerable part may be salt added in
cheese making. Like the milk from which it is made, cheese ash is
characterized chiefly by the presence of calcium (lime), magnesium,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
phosphorus, and iron, the average values as given in earlier bulletins
of the department<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> being 1.24 per cent calcium oxid, 0.049
per cent magnesium oxid, 1.49 per cent phosphorus pentoxid,
and 0.0015 per cent iron.</p>

<p>The total amount of the mineral matter needed per day by the
body is relatively small, yet mineral matter is very important. It is
commonly assumed and is probably true, that a mixed diet reasonably
varied and reasonably generous will supply all the ash constituent
which the body requires. If for any reason calcium and
phosphorus are lacking in the diet, the amounts may be readily
increased (as pointed out in one of the publications just cited) by a
free use of milk and such milk products as cheese and junket, without
decreasing the palatability of the diet or materially increasing its
cost.</p>

<p>Since cheese is ready to be eaten when it comes from the market,
it may be more interesting for some purposes to compare its composition
with that of cooked beef, freed from bone and from superfluous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
fat, such a piece as would be served to a person at the table.
Weight for weight, cheese has appreciably more protein than such
cooked beef, and 50 per cent more fat.</p>

<p>So far as its composition is concerned, then, cheese is entitled to be
considered as directly comparable with meat. The possibilities of using
cheese and some other food materials in the same way as meat is discussed
in some detail in an earlier publication of this department.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> It
is so used by the peasants of some parts of Europe, and was formerly
so used among many other groups of people. The fact that it is not
more commonly so used in this country is probably due to several
causes. One cause is habit, which makes the meal seem incomplete
unless it includes meat; another is the fact that since cheese has a
more pronounced flavor than meat, it is not so likely to be generally
acceptable as the chief food of a meal. There is always likely to be
at least one member of the family who does not relish it in quantity.
Another cause is the fact that it is commonly believed to be indigestible,
and still another is the fact that housekeepers, through lack
of experience, are much less skillful in the arrangement of bills of
fare in which cheese is the central food than they are in arranging
bills of fare in which meat is thus used. These last two causes will
be considered in sections which follow.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_DIGESTIBILITY_OF_CHEESE">THE DIGESTIBILITY OF CHEESE.</h2>
</div>


<p>As was stated above, cheese has been thought a cause of digestive
disturbances, but work recently done by the Office of Experiment
Stations, in cooperation with the Bureau of Animal Industry, and
briefly summed up in a recent publication tends to disprove this.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>In the large number of experiments which were conducted, young
men in good health were fed on a diet consisting of bread and fruit
combined with American factory cheese which was made with different
amounts of rennet and in different stages of ripening. The results
showed that over 90 per cent of the nitrogenous material of the cheese
was digested—that is, retained in the body—and nearly 90 per cent
of the energy it supplied was available. In other words, cheese compares
favorably with other foods in thoroughness of digestion—that
is, in the percentage finally digested. Furthermore, it did not
cause constipation or other physiological disturbances.</p>

<p>The above statement refers to full-cream cheese. Experiments
made at the same time gave practically the same values for the
digestibility of skim-milk cheese, of Swiss cheese, of Roquefort and
Camembert cheese, and of cottage cheese.</p>

<p>Artificial digestion experiments made at the Minnesota Agricultural
Experiment Station<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> indicate that cheese protein is digested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span>
by the ferments of the intestines rather than by those of the stomach,
and this is suggested as a reason for its reputation as a “hearty”
food, the belief being that some foods which remain in the stomach
longer than the average time, or are not digested by the stomach, are
“hearty.” Cheese protein (casein) is intimately associated with fat,
and there is experimental evidence to show that this condition has an
effect upon the progress of digestion in the stomach.</p>

<p>The burning sensation or similar sensations sometimes experienced
after eating certain sorts of cheese has been attributed to the
presence of small amounts of free fatty acids.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> It is commonly said
that cheese is difficult to digest, the idea being that the body expends
more labor in assimilating it than is required for other comparable
foods. Experiments recently carried on by the Office of Experiment
Stations in which the respiration calorimeter was used to study the
energy expenditure during the period of active digestion, do not
indicate that cheese differs materially in ease of digestion from a comparable
amount of meat.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a> Uncooked full-cream cheese was used in
these experiments. Another series recently begun by the Office of
Experiment Stations with cooked cheese, though not yet sufficiently
advanced to be conclusive, indicates that cheese thus eaten does not
differ materially from raw cheese in this respect.</p>

<p>In connection with the use of cooked cheese in the diet, one fact
should always be kept in mind. This is that, in common with all other
fatty foods, cheese which has been overheated in cooking is likely to
contain burned—that is, decomposed—fats. Disturbances from this
cause, however, should be laid to poor cooking and not to the composition
of this special food.</p>

<p>The use of potassium bicarbonate has often been recommended for
increasing the digestibility of cheese, the amount suggested being a
level teaspoonful to a pound of cheese. That the bicarbonate
renders the cheese soluble in any appreciable degree, as has been
claimed, is not apparent from a number of experiments which have
been made. It does, however, neutralize some of the free fatty
acids of the cheese, thus destroying some of the characteristic flavor.
To some people this may be an advantage, but to others it would be
counted a disadvantage.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_USE_OF_CHEESE_IN_THE_DIET">THE USE OF CHEESE IN THE DIET.</h2>
</div>


<p>It has been the purpose, in preparing this discussion of cheese, to
consider ways in which mild-flavored sorts may serve as staple articles
of diet, rather than the use of highly flavored varieties as appetizers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</span>
and as accompaniments of other foods. The use of highly flavored
cheese as a condiment is customary and may profitably be extended,
since it offers a simple way of adding to the attractiveness of the
diet. The variety of the cheese selected is a matter of choice, some
persons preferring such kinds as well-ripened American full-cream
cheese or the potted cheeses, and others such sorts as Roquefort,
Camembert, and other varieties. From the physiologist’s standpoint,
cheese used in this way for its flavor should really form a part of a
well-balanced meal rather than be added to a meal which already
supplies an abundance of nutritive material. In other words, condimental
cheeses may better accompany a moderate than a very generous
menu.</p>

<p>In considering the use of cheese in quantity as an integral part
of the diet there are many possibilities from simple combinations
like bread and cheese to elaborate dishes in which cheese is used
as a flavor and as a principal constituent.</p>

<p>As has been pointed out, cheese, being rich in both protein and fat,
would logically replace such foods as meat, fish, and eggs when taken
in quantity, rather than cereal foods characterized by a large amount
of starch, or succulent foods, such as vegetables and fruits. In
planning menus of which cheese forms a large part the housekeeper
should bear these facts in mind.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="BILL-OF-FARE_MAKING_WITH_CHEESE_AS_THE_CENTRAL_FOOD">BILL-OF-FARE MAKING WITH CHEESE AS THE CENTRAL FOOD.</h2>
</div>


<p>Since meat has so generally been the chief protein food of a meal,
and the kind selected usually has determined the choice of vegetables
and condiments, it is not strange that very many housekeepers
should be inexperienced and consequently unskillful in planning
meals in which cheese is substituted for meat when for any reason
they may desire to make such a change. In seeking skill they
might take a suggestion from the experiments to which reference
has been made, and also from a case investigated and reported by
the Office of Experiment Stations, of a man who lived for months
upon a diet of bread, fruit, and cheese, and who remained in good
health and active, and did not weary of the monotony of the diet.</p>

<p>The first two articles of the diet mentioned, namely, the bread and
the cheese, could have been taken in such amounts as to constitute
what is usually considered a balanced ration, i.e., in such amounts as
to supply the right quantity of muscle-forming foods in comparison
with the energy value. The bread and cheese taken with the fruit,
however, make a ration which is well balanced not only in the older
and more widely accepted sense, but also in the more modern sense
that it makes an attractive and palatable combination of foods, as
well as a balanced ration, and thus favors digestion. The watery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</span>
and refreshing fruits or succulent vegetables with their large supply
of cellulose are a pleasant contrast to the concentrated and fatty
cheese.</p>

<p>Housekeepers would probably find that if in planning menus of
which a cheese dish is the chief feature they were to take pains to
supply also crisp, watery vegetables, water cress, celery, lettuce
served with a dressing or with salt alone, or simple fruit salads, and
would give preference to refreshing fruits, either fresh or cooked,
rather than to what are known as heavy desserts, they would in
general be more successful in pleasing those who are served.</p>

<p>There is another point also to be considered in combining cheese
with other foods. Whether it is raw or cooked it is likely to be
somewhat soft, and so seems to call for the harder kinds of bread—crusty
rolls or biscuit, zweiback, toast, pulled bread, rye bread, the
harder brown breads, or crackers, and some of the numerous crisp
ready-to-eat cereal breakfast foods. Brittle cookies, too, seem more
suitable than rich soft cakes or puddings for the dessert in such meals.</p>

<p>A few bills of fare are given below which experience has shown to
represent combinations of dishes which are palatable and which, if
eaten in usual amounts, will supply protein and energy in proportions
which accord with usual dietary standards. Menus such as these
are more commonly served at lunch or at supper, but they might
equally well be served for dinner, the selection of dishes for any
meal being of course chiefly a matter of custom and convenience for
those who have any range of choice.</p>

<p>These bills of fare should be taken as suggestive merely and not as
a solution of the problem. In fact, the whole art of making bills of
fare needs developing. There is abundant evidence that overeating,
where it exists, is frequently due to the fact that meals are not skillfully
planned. People often continue eating after they have taken<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span>
enough in total bulk because they have not had all they want of
some particular kind of food. The meal has contained too large a
percentage of proteid or too much starch; has been too moist or too
dry; too highly flavored or not sufficiently flavored. Bill-of-fare
making calls not only for knowledge of food values but also for skill
in combining flavors and textures.</p>

<p>In this discussion of menu making, and of the use of cheese as an
integral part of the diet, the aim has been to suggest ways of using
cheese to add to the palatability of meals made up of usual dishes,
and to suggest dishes containing cheese which could serve as substitutes
for meat dishes when so desired, and also for dishes of many
sorts to be used as taste suggests and in which the nutritive value as
well as the flavor is increased by the addition of cheese. If cheese is
used and in quantity, it is obvious that some other proteid and fat
foods should be diminished, in order that the meal or day’s menu
may not be unduly hearty.</p>

<p>For the convenience of the housekeeper, a number of recipes for
cheese dishes are given in later pages, these being preceded by directions
for making cottage cheese and other similar cheeses which are
usually made in the home.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="HOMEMADE_CHEESE">HOMEMADE CHEESE.</h2>
</div>


<p>Even as late as a generation or two ago cheese of different kinds
was made at home for family use, as sour-milk or cottage cheese still
is, and cheese making was very generally a farm industry, cheese,
like butter, being sold by the farmer who made it. Cottage cheese
is very commonly homemade. Most types of cheese, however, are
now as a rule made on a large scale in factories where advantage may
be taken of labor-saving devices. The general topic of farm cheese
making has been considered in an earlier bulletin of this series,<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
prepared by the Dairy Division of the Bureau of Animal Industry.</p>


<h3 class="fs80">Curds and Whey.</h3>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Cheese curds and whey, an old-fashioned dish, which is often spoken of in accounts
of life in earlier times, sometimes refers to sour-milk curd and sometimes to curd
separated with rennet. This dish when made with rennet is much like junket and
though far less common to-day than was once the case is wholesome and palatable.</p>
</div>


<h3 class="fs80">Cottage Cheese.</h3>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>This cheese is very commonly prepared in the home, and the process of making it
is very simple. It consists merely of curdling the milk, separating the curd from the
whey, seasoning, and pressing it.</p>

<p>The curd is formed by the souring of the milk, and the process is hastened if the
milk is kept warm, the best temperature being about blood heat, 96° F. A temperature
much above this should be avoided, as the curd is likely to become hard and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
tough if much heated. The danger is usually not that the whole will be overheated
but that the portion nearest the fire will be. In the old-fashioned kitchen there
was usually a place where the milk could stand till it was uniformly warm throughout.
With our present cooking arrangements it is often desirable to hasten the process.
This may be done by setting the milk into a pan of warm water or by pouring hot water
directly into the milk itself. The effect of the latter method is to remove much
more of the acid than when the whey is left undiluted. Some consider this a great
advantage.</p>

<p>If, for any reason, the curd is overheated, it should be put through a meat chopper.
This will insure cottage cheese of excellent texture.</p>

<p>If the milk is thoroughly chilled before the whey is drained off it retains more of
the fat than if this is done when warm. Under no circumstances, however, is much
of the fat retained in cottage cheese. It is therefore more economical to make it out
of skim milk and to add the fat to the curd in the form of butter or cream.</p>

<p>Chopped parsley, caraway seeds, chopped olives, and pimiento may all be used for
flavoring if such flavored cheese is preferred to plain cottage cheese.</p>

<p>Cottage cheese<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> is most commonly consumed immediately, but if made in quantity
for commercial purposes, it may be packed in tubs and placed in cold storage. Sometimes
it is formed into rolls or blocks and wrapped in tinfoil when marketed. Such
cheese is used without ripening.</p>

<p>Though cottage cheese is usually made by allowing the milk to sour naturally, it is
sometimes more convenient to curdle the milk by adding rennet, and some housekeepers
have a preference for cottage cheese thus made, since the flavor is milder
and the acid taste which it possesses when made from sour milk is lacking.</p>
</div>


<h3 class="fs80">Sour-Cream Cheese.</h3>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>When cream is to be made into cheese similar to cottage cheese, it should be drained
without having previously been heated. The drainage is facilitated by moistening
the cloth in salt water before the cream is poured in. The curd is formed either by
souring or by the addition of rennet.</p>
</div>


<h3 class="fs80">Uncooked Curd, or French Cottage Cheese.</h3>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>The French make cheese from sour milk without heating it. They pour the milk
into earthen molds which have holes in the bottom. A very fine sieve may be used
instead of the molds. The whey drips out and the curd assumes a custard-like consistency
and takes the shape of the mold. When sufficiently stiff, the cheese is
chilled, and is eaten with sweet cream and sugar. It is a staple dessert in many
French families, especially in hot weather, and is delicious served with acid fruit,
such as currants, or with strawberries.</p>
</div>


<h3 class="fs80">Junket.</h3>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>If cottage cheese is made from sweet milk and rennet and served without breaking
and separating the curd and whey, the dish is called junket. It is customary to season
it a little, as with grated nutmeg or with cinnamon and sugar.</p>
</div>


<h3 class="fs80">Buttermilk Cheese.</h3>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>At the Wisconsin Experiment Station<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> a method has been devised for making a soft
moist cheese out of buttermilk. When made on a large scale, as it might be in creameries,
there are various precautions to be taken which are pointed out in the publication
cited. In making it in small quantities, these precautions are unnecessary, and
the method is even simpler than that of making cottage cheese, because the quality
does not depend so much on the temperature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span></p>

<p>To make the buttermilk cheese, heat buttermilk gradually to about 130° or 140° F.
Allow it to cool and strain it. As the curd will settle to the bottom, most of the whey
may be poured off before the draining is begun.</p>

<p>This cheese is, of course, almost wholly without fat and yet, probably because the
particles of curd are very finely divided, it has a smooth consistency, which suggests
the presence of fat. It may be served seasoned with salt only or it may be mixed with
butter or cream and seasonings. It is suitable for combining with olives and pimientos,
as recommended on page <a href="#Page_34">34</a>, or for any use to which the ordinary cream cheeses are
put.</p>
</div>

<h3 class="fs80">Buttermilk Cream.</h3>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>This product also was devised by the Wisconsin Experiment Station.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> By controlling
the temperature in heating the buttermilk and not allowing it to go above 100° F.,
a compound is made which after draining has the consistency of a very thick cream.
It is claimed by the station investigators that this “cream” is suitable for eating on
bread in place of butter.</p>

<p>The recipes on pages <a href="#Page_34">34</a> and <a href="#Page_35">35</a> suggest ways of making a salad dressing out of buttermilk
cream.</p>
</div>


<h3 class="fs80">Devonshire Cream.</h3>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Devonshire cream somewhat resembles sweet cream in flavor and consistency. It
is very much liked in England, where it is commonly eaten with fresh or preserved
fruit, but is not so well known in America.</p>

<p>To make Devonshire cream, allow a pan of whole milk to stand for 24 hours in a cool
place or for 12 hours in a warmer place. Place the pan on the cooler part of the stove
and heat until the milk is very hot, but not to the boiling point. If heated too
much a thick skin will form on the surface. The more slowly the milk is heated the
better. Having been heated, the milk should be kept in a cool place for 24 hours
and then skimmed. The thick cream obtained has a characteristic flavor and
texture.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHEESE_DISHES_AND_THEIR_PREPARATION">CHEESE DISHES AND THEIR PREPARATION.</h2>
</div>


<p>The list of cheese dishes in the culinary literature of this and other
countries is a long one, but most of them are variations of a comparatively
small number of general types. Those which have been
selected and studied experimentally represent the principal types
and in many cases have been adapted to American methods of
preparations and tastes. In some instances, this has resulted in new
and perhaps more rational combinations than those which served as
models.</p>

<p>For convenience, the cheese dishes included in this bulletin have
been grouped under the following heads:</p>

<p class="lh">(1) Cheese dishes which may serve as meat substitutes.</p>
<p class="lh">(2) Cheese soups and vegetables cooked with cheese.</p>
<p class="lh">(3) Cheese salads, sandwiches, and similar dishes.</p>
<p class="lh">(4) Cheese pastry, cheese sweets, and similar dishes.</p>

<p>Variety may be obtained in the recipes by varying the flavorings.
Among the best flavorings for cheese dishes are onion, chives, and
the ordinary green sweet pepper. Since the cheese needs very little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</span>
cooking, however, and onion or the pepper needs a great deal, they
should always be previously cooked, either by stewing in a very
little water, or by cooking in butter. The seeds of the pepper, of
course, should be removed before cooking. Where chopped celery
is used, as it may be in most of these dishes, it, too, should be cooked
beforehand until tender. Other good flavors are mustard, curry
powder, onion juice, chopped olives, pimiento, and, according to
European recipes, nutmeg or mace.</p>

<p>In preparing the cheese it often has been found convenient to use
a very coarse grater having slits instead of the usual rounded holes.
Such a grater, in spite of its name, shaves the cheese instead of
grating it. When the cheese is soft this is an advantage, since the
grater does not become clogged.</p>


<div class="chapter">
<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHEESE_DISHES_WHICH_MAY_BE_USED_IN_THE_SAME_WAY">CHEESE DISHES WHICH MAY BE USED IN THE SAME WAY
AS MEAT.</h2>
</div>


<p>Meat is wholesome and relished by most persons, yet it is not
essential to a well-balanced meal and there are many housekeepers
who for one reason or another are interested in lessening the amount
of meat which they provide or to substitute some other foods for it.
The problem with the average family is undoubtedly more often the
occasional substitution of other palatable dishes for the sake of
variety, for reasons of economy, or for some other reason than the
general replacement of meat dishes by other things.</p>

<p>Foods which are to be served in place of meat should be rich in
protein and fat and should also be savory. Cheese naturally suggests
itself as a substitute for meat, since it is rich in the same kinds
of nutrients which meat supplies, is a staple food with which everyone
is familiar, and is one which can be used in a great variety of ways.
In substituting cheese for meat, especial pains should be taken to
serve dishes which are relished by the members of the family. A
number of recipes for dishes which contain cheese are given below.
They are preceded by several recipes for cheese sauces which, as
will appear, are called for in the preparation of some of the more
substantial dishes.</p>


<h3 class="fs80">Cheese Sauce No. 1.</h3>

<table class="autotable fs80">
<tr>
<td class="tdl">1 cupful of milk.</td>
<td class="tdlz bl">1 ounce of cheese (¼ cupful of grated cheese).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="tdl">2 tablespoonfuls of flour.</td>
<td class="tdlz bl" style="width:50%">Salt and pepper.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Thicken the milk with the flour and just before serving add the cheese, stirring until
it is melted.</p>

<p>This sauce is suitable to use in preparing creamed eggs, or to pour over toast, making
a dish corresponding to ordinary milk toast, except for the presence of cheese. It may
be seasoned with a little curry powder and poured over hard-boiled eggs.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</span></p>


<h3 class="fs80">Cheese Sauce No. 2.</h3>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Same as cheese sauce No. 1, except that the cheese is increased from 1 to 2 ounces.</p>

<p>This sauce is suitable for using with macaroni or rice, or for baking with crackers
soaked in milk. (See p. <a href="#Page_27">27</a>.)</p>
</div>


<h3 class="fs80">Cheese Sauce No. 3.</h3>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Same as cheese sauce No. 1, except that two cupfuls of grated cheese or 8 ounces are
used. This may be used upon toast as a substitute for Welsh rabbit.</p>
</div>


<h3 class="fs80">Cheese Sauce No. 4.</h3>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Same as cheese sauce No. 2, save that 2 tablespoonfuls of melted butter are mixed
with the flour before the latter is put into the milk. This sauce is therefore very
rich in fat and has only a mild flavor of cheese.</p>
</div>

<p>Among the recipes for dishes which may be used like meat, the
first 30 are such that, eaten in usual quantities, they will provide
much the same kind and amount of nutritive material as the ordinary
servings of meat dishes used at dinner. In several cases there is a
resemblance in appearance and flavor to common meat dishes, which
would doubtless be a point in their favor with many families.</p>

<p>While, chiefly owing to custom, it may not accord with the taste
of the family to serve cheese dishes at dinner in place of meat, it is
much more in accord with usual dietary habits in American homes
to serve such dishes at least occasionally for lunch, for supper, or
for breakfast; that is, for a less formal meal than dinner. The last
group of recipes in this section, beginning with “breakfast cereals
with cheese,” supply rather smaller proportions of nutritive materials
than those in the first group and so may be more suitable for use at
the less hearty meals. There is no hard and fast line to be drawn
between the two groups, however, and many of the recipes may be
used interchangeably.</p>

<p>In the recipes calling for large amounts of cheese the food value is
given, not in figures, but in comparison with beef of average composition
and average percentage of waste. This comparison is necessarily
rough owing to the varying composition of the foods and the
varying weights of such ingredients as a cupful of grated cheese or
bread crumbs. In making the comparisons, beef of average composition
has been considered to have 15.2 per cent of protein, and a
fuel value of 935 calories per pound; ordinary American cheese has
been considered to have 26 per cent of protein and a fuel value of
1,965 calories per pound. After many weighings, 4 ounces was
decided to be the average weight of a cupful of cheese and 2½ ounces
the average weight of a cupful of bread crumbs. These weights have
been taken, therefore, in calculating the food value of dishes. When
cheese is very soft, however, it may be pressed into a cup and measured
like butter. Under these circumstances, the weight of a cupful
of cheese may be considered one-half a pound. The price of cheese<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
is taken as 22 cents a pound, of butter 25 cents a pound, of eggs 25
cents a dozen, in this and all similar calculations in this bulletin.
Prices vary with time, place, and season. Those mentioned above
are such as were paid for materials at the time the experiments here
summarized were made and are not extreme values in either direction.
Like all such estimates, the calculations are only relative, and
the housekeeper who wishes to estimate the comparative cost of the
cheese dishes and other foods can readily do so by taking into account
the amount of materials used and the prices paid for ingredients at
any particular time.</p>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>The protein value of this dish is equal to that of 1⅛ pounds of potato and beef, the
fuel value, however, being much in excess of these. Calculated cost (see p. <a href="#Page_23">23</a>), 22
cents.</p>

<p>In making either of these fondues, rice or other cereals may be substituted for bread
crumbs. One-fourth cupful of rice measured before cooking, or one cupful of cooked
rice or other cereals, should be used.</p>

<p>A comparison of the recipes for the two fondues may indicate the general principle
on which the recipes in this bulletin have been worked out. The second recipe is
one commonly found in cookbooks. In the first one, the butter has been omitted
and water substituted for milk and the amount of cheese is slightly increased. This
makes a somewhat cheaper dish and one which is less rich because its percentage of
fat is not so great. For this reason it is easier to adjust to the ordinary bill of fare. A
dish in which there is combined cheese with its large percentage of fat, butter with
its 85 per cent of fat, and eggs with their 10 per cent of fat, is too rich to admit of being
combined rationally with other fatty dishes. It therefore limits the number of dishes
that may be served with it, making milk soup, for example, or dishes containing white
sauce or those containing much butter or oil seem out of place. The omission of butter
from the ordinary recipes and the substitution of water or skimmed milk for whole
milk may perhaps be the means of making cheese dishes more wholesome and more
generally acceptable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span></p>

<p>Another advantage of omitting butter from cheese dishes and of substituting water
or skimmed milk for whole milk is that it makes it possible to increase the amount
of cheese without making the dish too rich. This is of advantage to those who like
the flavor of cheese, and also, because it tends to increase the tissue-forming value of
the dish, particularly if skimmed milk is used rather than water.</p>

<h3 class="fs80">Breakfast Cereals with Cheese.</h3>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>That cheese combined with cereal foods makes a rational dish as regards the proportion
of nutrients it supplies has been pointed out on another page (p. <a href="#Page_18">18</a>). Cheese
and some of the crisp “ready to serve” cereal breakfast foods is a combination which
is common, the cheese being melted with the cereal food, or simply served with it.</p>

<p>There are many who relish a piece of cheese with the cooked cereal so commonly
eaten for breakfast and find such a combination satisfying to appetite and taste.
Oatmeal or some other home-cooked breakfast cereal prepared with cheese is palatable,
and such dishes have an advantage in that they may be served without cream and
sugar. Since such a dish contains considerably more protein than the breakfast
cereals as ordinarily served, it has a further advantage in that it may well serve as
the principal item of a breakfast menu, instead of a preliminary to other courses.
Such a combination as cereals cooked with cheese, toast, fruit, and tea, coffee, or
chocolate, makes a palatable as well as nutritious breakfast and one which does not
require much work to prepare and to clear away. A recipe for preparing oatmeal
with cheese follows. Wheat breakfast foods, either parched or unparched, corn meal,
and hominy may be prepared in the same way.</p>

<p>In these dishes the cheese is used not only to add nutritive value,
but also to give its characteristic flavor either to materials otherwise
rather mild in taste (as in potatoes with cheese) or to combine its
flavor with that of some more highly flavored vegetables (as in cheese
and vegetable soup). The ingenious housekeeper whose family is
fond of cheese can doubtless think of many desirable ways of making
such combinations besides those given in the following recipes:</p>

</div>


<p>Cheese of one sort or another is a very common accompaniment of
salads, and the combination is rational as well as palatable, for the
constituents of the succulent foods—chiefly water and cellulose—supplement
the protein and fat of the cheese. Cheese is often used
also as a part of the salad.</p>

<p>A number of recipes are given below for cheese salads and other
cheese dishes which may be served with dinner or other regular
meals, or served as part of a special lunch or special supper. Many
of the cheese dishes discussed in other sections are also commonly
used for such occasions when something savory is desired which can
be easily and quickly prepared.</p>


<h3 class="fs80">Cheese with Salads.</h3>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Cheese or cheese dishes are an acceptable addition to salads. Neufchâtel or other
cream cheese, either plain or mixed with pimientos and olives, may be passed with
lettuce or may be cut into slices and served on lettuce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span></p>

<p>Cheese balls are often served with salad. They are made of some soft cream cheese,
and are frequently combined with chopped chives, olives, sweet peppers, chopped
nuts, etc., for the sake of adding flavor. Cooked egg yolk, spinach extract, etc., are
sometimes mixed in for the sake of color. If the balls are rolled in chopped chives or
parsley, both flavor and color are supplied.</p>
</div>


<h3 class="fs80">Plain Cheese Salad.</h3>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Cut Edam or ordinary American cheese into thin pieces, scatter them over lettuce
leaves, and serve with French dressing.</p>
</div>


<h3 class="fs80">Olive and Pimiento Sandwich or Salad Cheese.</h3>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Mash any of the soft cream cheeses and add chopped olives and pimientos in equal
parts. This mixture requires much salt to make it palatable to most palates, the
amount depending chiefly on the quantity of pimiento used. The mixture may be
spread between thin slices of bread or it may be made into a roll or molded, cut into
slices, and served on lettuce leaves with French dressing.</p>
</div>


<h3 class="fs80">Cheese and Tomato Salad.</h3>

<p>Mix the cheese with the whipped cream, season to taste with salt and pepper, and
add to the gelatin dissolved in a scant cupful of water. This may be molded in a large
mold or in small molds.</p>

<p>When the jelly begins to harden, cover with grated cheese. The jelly should be
served on a lettuce leaf, preferably with a cream dressing or a French dressing, to
which a little grated cheese has been added.</p>
</div>


<h3 class="fs80">Cheese Salad and Preserves.</h3>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>Epicures have devised a dish which consists of lettuce with French dressing served
with cream cheese and thick preparations of currants or other fruits preserved in
honey or sugar, which, owing to the fact that the seeds have been extracted by a
laborious process, are fairly expensive. The soft cheese often found in market is also
relatively expensive. There is a suggestion in this dish, however, for others which
are much less costly. Buttermilk cream (see p. <a href="#Page_21">21</a>), or ordinary cottage cheese served
with lettuce or other green salad and a small amount of rich homemade preserves, is a
combination with much the same character, and also very appetizing.</p>

<h3 class="fs80">Deviled Eggs with Cheese.</h3>

<div class="blockquot fs80">

<p>In making deviled eggs, either to be eaten alone or upon lettuce leaves in the form

salad dressing and flavorings with which the yolks are mixed.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHEESE_PASTRY_CHEESE_SWEETS_AND_SIMILAR_DISHES">CHEESE PASTRY, CHEESE SWEETS, AND SIMILAR DISHES.</h2>
</div>


<p>In the foregoing pages a large number of recipes have been included
in which cheese is combined with materials without cooking, as in
salads, or used in cooked dishes of creamy or custard-like consistency,
as in soufflés and Welsh rabbit or in combination with vegetables or
cereals, such as rice.</p>

<p>There are a number of cheese dishes of quite different character in
which the cheese is combined with dough, batter, or pastry in various
ways, and a number of dishes in which cheese or cheese curd is used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</span>
in combinations suitable for dessert. Such sweet dishes were once
much more common than they are to-day, as reference to old cookery
books will show, but some of them are well worth retaining.</p>

<p>In cheese sweets, flavor and richness are both contributed by the
cheese.</p>

<p>When cheese is used in pastry or dough it may serve simply as a
flavor, as in cheese sticks or cheese straws, or it may wholly or in part
replace with its fat the usual shortening, as butter or other fat, and
with its protein (casein) the protein (albumin) of eggs. As an illustration
of such a use of cheese, cheese gingerbread may be cited.</p>

<p>Using cheese in this way is often an economy when eggs are scarce.
Better results will be obtained if soft cheese is used which can be
worked into the dough in much the same way as butter or other
shortening. To those who like cheese the flavor which it imparts
would be an advantage. However, if a very mild cheese is used in
combination with molasses or spice the dish differs a little in flavor
from one prepared in the usual way.</p>

<p>In the foregoing pages information has been summarized regarding
the food value of cheese, an important agricultural product, and ways
of preparing it for the table. It has been pointed out that, judged
by the kind of nutrients it supplies—chiefly nitrogenous material and
fat—and the proportion in which they are present, it resembles such
foodstuffs as meat, fish, and eggs, which means that like them its
rational use in the diet is in combination with other staple foods,
to form well-balanced meals.</p>

<p>Experiments have shown that when eaten either raw or carefully
cooked, cheese is as thoroughly digested as other staple foods and
is not likely to produce physiological disturbance.</p>

<p>An ounce of cheese roughly is equivalent to 1 egg, to a glass of milk,
or to 2 ounces of meat.</p>

<p>Although uncooked cheese resembles meat in composition, cheese
dishes prepared after ordinary recipes, with milk and shortening, are
likely to contain more fat than meat dishes prepared in the usual
ways. When, therefore, such cheese dishes are served with other
staple foods the combination is likely to contain more fat than the
usual meal. If little fat is ordinarily used, this may be an advantage.
If a great deal of fat is ordinarily used, it may be desirable to lessen
the amount in the cheese dishes. This can readily be done by
omitting the shortening and using skim milk or water in the preparation
of such dishes, a change which also lessens their cost.</p>

<p>The fact that cheese, like meat, contains neither starch nor cellulose
suggests that, like meat, it should be combined with bread, potatoes,
and other starchy foods, with vegetables and with sweets. The
concentrated character of cheese and many cheese dishes suggests<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span>
the use of succulent fruits and vegetables with them. The high
percentage of fat in cheese suggests the use of correspondingly small
amounts of fat in the accompanying dishes, while the soft texture
of cheese dishes as compared with meat makes it reasonable to serve
the harder and crustier breads with them.</p>

<p>When cheese is not used as the chief nitrogenous food of a meal it
may be introduced into bills of fare in many incidental ways, and
thus add materially to that portion of the diet needed for building and
repairing body tissue.</p>

<p>Though cheese is so generally used in some way in most families,
yet the making of menus with cheese as a central dish is less well
understood than more usual food combinations, since there is less
experience to serve as a guide. More thought is therefore usually
required to arrange such cheese meals in order that they may be
palatable and at the same time reasonable in nutritive value.</p>

<p>In order that the diet may remain well balanced, cheese, if used in
quantity, should replace foods of similar composition rather than
supplement them. The builder who has a choice of materials must
have a knowledge of their relative properties if he wishes to use stone
instead of brick, or wood in place of iron. It is the same with the
housekeeper who wishes to use her available food supply intelligently
and whose choice of foods is influenced by their relative cost at a given
time or season. The woman who has a knowledge of the relative
food value of different articles of diet, and their real food qualities as
distinguished from their market value, who understands good methods
of cooking and serving foods, and who plans her meals and other
housework so that unnecessary labor and expense may be avoided,
is taking account of the things which make for economical living as
well as for good living.</p>

<p>Some persons seem to believe that cheese or fish or other food is the
ideal food for some particular circumstance and that there is a special
food or diet suited to each kind of work and to every circumstance of
our daily life, and that it would be a great advantage if we could
regulate our daily fare with the accuracy a chemist uses in making
an experiment. Work, recreation, the amount of clothing we wear,
and other details of our daily life are not so regulated, and it is the
belief of those who have studied the subject that the best interests
of persons living under normal conditions are served if the ideal be
rather the regulation of the diet along general lines in accordance
with good sense, the teachings of experience, economy, and the available
knowledge gained from a scientific study of the subject, due care
being taken that the different staple foodstuffs are so combined that
all the needs of the body are provided, excessive waste is prevented,
and that both undernourishment and excess or overeating are avoided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</span></p>

<p>Dishes which are liked and the methods followed in preparing them
will vary in different countries and at different times, yet this does
not of necessity mean that the nutritive value of the diet varies
correspondingly. In the same way it is possible for us to vary the
selection of our foods and the character of our diet at will, according
to the demands of our taste and our purse, without correspondingly
changing its value for supplying the needs of the body. This means
that the housekeeper, in suitable ways, can use cheese, meat, fish,
eggs, and other foods of similar composition as substitutes for one
another, being governed by their relative market value at different
times and seasons, by the tastes of her family, and similar considerations.
If she uses the different foodstuffs with reference to their
nutritive value and is skillful in preparing foods in appetizing ways
and in serving them in attractive combinations, the daily fare may
be both adequate and pleasing, whether she selects cheese or meat
or fish or eggs or other foods to supply nitrogenous material and fat.
Here, as in all that pertains to housekeeping, true economy is dependent
upon a knowledge of materials and skill in using them.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
